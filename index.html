<p>Meaning, is a critique on the use of platforms such as YouTube. As the YouTube space has grown and content creator’s potential wealth has skyrocketed, with the help from ad cents, subscribers, views, and sponsored videos from major corporations, the more YouTuber's seem to turn into product spokespeople. Turning their videos from inspirational meaningful pieces into cheaper advertisements to companies. Meaning, replicates these videos giving the viewer a sense of wonder and intrigue, then snapping the viewer back to reality. Sometimes simple things can make us think of a deeper meaning, then again sometimes it’s just an egg.</p>
