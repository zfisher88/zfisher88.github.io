<p>Meaning, is a critique on the use of platforms such as YouTube. As the YouTube space has grown and content creator’s potential wealth has skyrocketed, with the help from ad cents, subscribers, views, and sponsored videos from major corporations, the more YouTuber's seem to turn into product spokespeople. Turning their videos from inspirational meaningful pieces into cheaper advertisements to companies. Meaning, replicates these videos giving the viewer a sense of wonder and intrigue, then snapping the viewer back to reality. Sometimes simple things can make us think of a deeper meaning, then again sometimes it’s just an egg.</p>

<p>Attention is an observation/critic of how people use their cell phones all the time even when they walk. It doesn’t matter if they are walking on the sidewalk or crossing a street there are people with their faces constantly glued to their phones. In this video I have two videos going at the same time. At the bottom the camera is on my phone as I am walking around. At the top there are multiple videos of beautiful sites. The main point of this piece is to remind people that there are some great things to see out in the real world if you pay attention.</p>
