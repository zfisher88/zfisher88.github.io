  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p>While I do enjoy and appreciate the seriousness of some artist, the majority of my work tends to have a comedic element added to it. I find that people have a tendency to really look at a reflection of themselves, or of society, if there’s a bit of light humor added to it. The main goal of my work is to uncover the characteristics I see of people, society, and generally the world around me.</p>
