  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
</header>
<p>While I do enjoy and appreciate the seriousness of some artist, the majority of my work tends to have a comedic element added to it. I find that people have a tendency to really look at a reflection of themselves, or of society, if there’s a bit of light humor added to it. The main goal of my work is to uncover the characteristics I see of people, society, and generally the world around me.
I’ve always been an observer. Noticing things that people do that they, at times, are oblivious to. Rather than blatantly calling them out on their characteristics I’ve always enjoyed coming up with ways to playfully poke fun at their traits until they recognized it themselves. That is the same way I go about my art. There are times when my work can’t be as playful, and I’ll have to take things as serious as they are. But I’ll always try to find some humor, life is serious enough.
